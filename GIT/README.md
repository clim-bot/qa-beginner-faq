Git is a version control system used to track changes in code, collaborate with others, and manage project versions. It helps developers keep a history of their work and coordinate on projects.

### Common Git Commands:
- git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
```bash
git init
```
- git clone: Copy an existing repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
- git add: Stage changes for the next commit.
```bash
git add .
```
- git commit: Save changes to the repository with a message.
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
- git push: Upload changes to a remote repository.
```bash
git push origin main
```
- git pull: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
```bash
git pull origin main
```

Git helps manage code versions, collaborate with team members, and maintain a clean history of changes.
