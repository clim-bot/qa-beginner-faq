DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to automate and integrate processes between software development and IT teams. Its goal is to improve collaboration, increase efficiency, and deliver software faster and more reliably.

### Key Concepts:
- Continuous Integration (CI): Regularly merging code changes into a shared repository and automatically testing them.
- Continuous Deployment (CD): Automating the deployment of new code to production after passing tests.
Monitoring: Tracking application performance and infrastructure for issues in real-time.

### Example:
In a DevOps environment, a team automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code using tools like Jenkins (for CI/CD) and Docker (for containerization). When developers commit code, itâ€™s automatically tested and deployed to production if it passes.
