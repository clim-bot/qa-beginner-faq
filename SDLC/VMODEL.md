The V-Model (Verification and Validation model) is an extension of the Waterfall model. It emphasizes testing at each development stage. For every development phase, there’s a corresponding testing phase.

### Key Stages:
- Requirement Analysis ↔ Acceptance Testing
- System Design ↔ System Testing
- Architectural Design ↔ Integration Testing
- Module Design ↔ Unit Testing

The left side represents development, and the right side represents testing. The two sides form a "V" shape, illustrating the close relationship between development and testing.

### Example:
During System Design, testers prepare System Test Plans.
After implementation, System Testing is performed based on those plans.
