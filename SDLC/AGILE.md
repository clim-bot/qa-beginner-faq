Agile is a flexible and iterative approach to software development. It focuses on delivering small, functional pieces of a project in short cycles, responding quickly to changes and customer feedback.

### Scrum:
- A framework within Agile used to manage complex projects.
- Work is broken down into Sprints (usually 1-4 weeks).
- Roles include Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
- Scrum events: Daily Standups, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Retrospective.

**Example**: A team developing an app plans features for a 2-week sprint. Each day, they discuss progress in a standup. After the sprint, they review what was built and plan improvements for the next sprint.

### Kanban:
- A visual method for managing workflow.
- Focuses on continuous delivery with tasks visualized on a Kanban Board.
- Tasks move through stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- It limits the number of tasks in progress at any time to avoid bottlenecks.

**Example**: A support team tracks bug fixes on a Kanban board. As team members finish a task, they pull the next one from the "To Do" column.


### Story Points
Story points are a unit of measure used in Agile to estimate the effort or complexity of completing a user story or task. Instead of using hours, story points help teams focus on the relative difficulty of a task, factoring in things like risk, complexity, and time.

#### Key Points:
- They are relative: A story with 5 points should be roughly twice as complex as a 2-point story.
- Typically use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.) to size tasks.
- Teams use planning poker to agree on story point values.

#### Example:
- A small bug fix = 1 point.
- A medium feature addition = 3 points.
- A complex feature requiring research = 8 points.

#### Purpose:
Story points help Agile teams predict how much work they can complete in a sprint (velocity) and improve planning over time.
