The Waterfall model in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. It’s one of the oldest and most traditional models, often used in projects with well-defined requirements. The process flows in one direction, much like a waterfall, through stages such as:

- Requirement Gathering and Analysis: The project’s requirements are collected, and the system’s functionalities are documented.
- System Design: Based on the requirements, the architecture and design of the system are created.
- Implementation: The actual code for the system is written.
- Integration and Testing: Once the coding is complete, the system is tested to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
- Deployment: After testing, the system is deployed to the production environment.
- Maintenance: Once the system is operational, ongoing maintenance is done to fix any issues or update features.


### Example of Waterfall Model:
Imagine developing software for a banking application that handles account transactions. Using the Waterfall model, the bank will first gather detailed requirements (e.g., user roles, types of transactions, security protocols). Then, a detailed design for each module (such as the customer portal, transaction handling, and reporting) is created. After that, coding starts based on the design. Testing follows, ensuring that transactions are processed securely and accurately. Once everything is thoroughly tested, the software is deployed to the bank’s systems. After launch, any issues encountered will be addressed during the maintenance phase.

### Key Features:
- Linear and sequential: Each phase depends on the completion of the previous one.
- Clear documentation: Every phase is well-documented before moving to the next.
- Suitable for smaller projects: Typically for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change.
