Test case development is the process of designing specific test cases based on the requirements or functionality to ensure that the software behaves as expected. Each test case includes the inputs, actions, and expected outcomes for a particular scenario.

### Key Components of a Test Case:
- Test Case ID: A unique identifier for the test case.
- Description: A brief description of what is being tested.
Preconditions: Any setup required before the test (e.g., user must be logged in).
- Test Steps: The specific steps to perform the test.
- Expected Result: The expected outcome after executing the steps.
- Actual Result: What actually happens (filled during testing).


### Example of a Simple Test Case:
| Test Case ID|	TC001 |
|-------------|-------|
|Description|	Test login functionality with valid|
credentials
|Preconditions|	User is on the login page|
|Test Steps	| 1. Enter valid username<br>2. Enter valid password<br>3. Click "Login" button`|
|Expected Result|	User successfully logs in and sees the dashboard|
|Actual Result|	(To be filled during execution)|


Test case development ensures every feature or function is tested properly, making the software more reliable.
