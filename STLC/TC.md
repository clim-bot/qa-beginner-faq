Test closure is the final phase in the testing process, where all testing activities are completed, and the team ensures that the software meets the quality standards. It involves documenting the overall test results, evaluating test coverage, and confirming that all defects are addressed.

### Key Activities:
- Review test results: Ensure all test cases have been executed and defects are resolved.
- Documentation: Summarize the testing process, including successes, failures, and lessons learned.
- Handover: Provide necessary documents and test reports to stakeholders.
- Sign-off: Officially conclude the testing phase.

### Example:
After all tests for a banking app are completed, a test closure report is prepared, summarizing the number of test cases run, the number of defects found, and the final status of the software. The testing team signs off on the project, marking it ready for release.

Test closure ensures the project has met quality goals and provides a final assessment before deployment.
