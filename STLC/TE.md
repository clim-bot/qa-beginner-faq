Test execution is the process of running the actual test cases and comparing the expected results with the actual results to determine whether the software is functioning as intended.

### Key Steps in Test Execution:
- Prepare the test environment: Ensure everything is set up for testing (e.g., database, servers).
- Execute the test cases: Follow the steps in the test case to perform the test.
- Log results: Compare the actual results with the expected results and record whether the test passed or failed.
- Report defects: If any issues are found, they are logged as defects and sent to developers for fixing.

#### Example:
Let's say we are testing the login feature.
- Test Case: Login with valid credentials.
- Execution: Enter a valid username and password, then click the login button.
- Expected Result: The user should be redirected to the dashboard.
- Actual Result: If the user successfully logs in and sees the dashboard, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.
