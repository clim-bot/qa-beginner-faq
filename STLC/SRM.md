Defect Reporting and Management is the process of identifying, documenting, tracking, and resolving bugs or issues found during testing. The goal is to ensure that defects are fixed before the software is released.

### Key Steps:
- Defect Reporting: When a defect is found, it's documented in a bug-tracking tool (e.g., Jira) with details like severity, steps to reproduce, and expected vs. actual results.
- Defect Triage: Defects are reviewed, prioritized, and assigned to developers.
- Fix and Retest: Developers fix the defect, and testers retest to ensure itâ€™s resolved.
- Closure: Once verified, the defect is marked as closed.

### Example:
- Defect: User cannot log in with valid credentials.
- Severity: High.
- Steps to Reproduce:
    - Go to the login page.
    - Enter valid username and password.
    - Click "Login".
- Expected Result: User is logged in.
- Actual Result: Login fails with an error message.

Effective defect reporting ensures that issues are resolved quickly, improving software quality.
