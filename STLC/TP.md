Test planning is the process of defining the objectives, scope, approach, and focus of software testing for a project. It lays out the roadmap for how testing will be carried out and ensures everyone is aligned on the goals and strategy.

### Key Components of a Test Plan:
- Scope: What will be tested (features, systems) and what will not.
- Test Strategy: The approach to testing (manual, automated, tools).
- Resources: Who will do the testing and what tools are required.
- Schedule: When tests will be executed, including milestones.
- Risks: Identifying potential challenges or risks.

### Example:
In a project for a banking app, the test plan might include:
- Scope: Test user login, transactions, and reporting features.
- Strategy: Use automated tests for login and manual tests for complex transactions.
- Resources: A QA team of 3 using Selenium and Postman.
- Schedule: Complete testing in 3 weeks.
- Risks: Delays in receiving necessary data from the API team.
