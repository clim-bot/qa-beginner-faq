## Types of Testing
- Functional Testing: Verifies that each function of the software works as expected.
    - Example: Testing a login feature to ensure users can log in successfully.

- Regression Testing: Ensures that recent code changes donâ€™t break existing functionality.
    - Example: Retesting login after new features were added elsewhere.

- Smoke and Sanity Testing:
    - Smoke: Quick, broad checks to ensure basic functionality works.
        - Example: Testing that the app opens and core features like login are accessible.
    - Sanity: Narrow, focused checks to verify new changes work properly.
        - Example: Testing only the newly added user profile feature.
    - Integration Testing: Tests interactions between different components/modules of the system.
        - Example: Testing how the login module interacts with the user database.

- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Performed by end users to ensure the software meets their needs.
    - Example: Customers testing an app to ensure it works as required before launch.

- Compatibility Testing: Ensures the software works across different devices, browsers, and platforms.
    - Example: Testing the website on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and on mobile.

- Exploratory Testing: Simultaneous learning and testing without pre-defined test cases.
    - Example: A tester navigates the app freely, looking for unexpected behavior.
    
These tests help ensure the software is of high quality and ready for release.
